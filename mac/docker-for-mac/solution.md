# Development Toolkit for Kubernetes on Docker for Mac

Docker for Mac (on Edge channel) includes a local Kubernetes cluster which is very delightful for test and development. Refer to the official document ([https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#kubernetes](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#kubernetes)) to know how to get it up and running.

If you are using Kubernetes on Docker for Mac, some scripts in this repository might be helpful.

Because the Docker for Mac containers are actually running in a VM powered by
HyperKit, you can't directly have interactions with the containers. More details here, _[Docker for Mac - Networking - Known limitations, use cases, and workarounds](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#known-limitations-use-cases-and-workarounds)_.

To solve this problem, run an OpenVPN server container inside the VM with `host` network mode, then you can reach the containers with its internal IP. You can run the OpenVPN server with docker-compose or on Kubernetes.

Off course you can follow the docker-compose approach without Kubernetes.

Generally, it works like this:

``` Text
Mac <-> Tunnelblick <-> socat/service <-> OpenVPN Server <-> Containers
```

``` Bash

### Prepare

1. Install [`Tunnelblick`](https://tunnelblick.net/downloads.html) (an open source GUI OpenVPN client for Mac).

2. Change into the `docker-for-mac-openvpn` directory.


### Run OpenVPN server with docker-compose

Run the OpenVPN server, it'll generate certificates and configurations at the first time, maybe a little slow.

``` Bash
$ # Run
$ docker-compose up -d
$ # Follow logs
$ docker-compose logs -f
```

### Configure Client

Now, you will get the client config file at `./local/docker-for-mac.ovpn`. Add the subnets that you want to reach at bottom of the client config like below, and connect to the local OpenVPN server.

``` Config
route 192.168.65.0 255.255.255.0
route 10.96.0.0 255.240.0.0
route 172.17.0.0 255.255.0.0
```

### Test Network

Run a container and access to it directory with it's IP address.

``` Bash
$ # Start Nginx
$ docker run --rm -it nginx

$ # Find out the IP address
$ docker inspect `docker ps | grep nginx | awk '{print $1}'` | grep '"IPAddress"'
"IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",

$ # Visit
$ curl http://172.17.0.2

<title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
...
```
